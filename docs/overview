After the user has pressed the "Pay" button on your checkout-page, here's what's happening:

1. Payum generates two entities and persists them to the database:

    * Payment: Basic info like amount, or . Fields: [Entity Payment](https://github.com/Payum/Payum/blob/master/src/Payum/Core/Model/Payment.php)
    
    * Token: A unique string for this payment.
    This is used to generate an unique URL (mostly referred to as "success url").
    Fields: [Entity Token](https://github.com/Payum/Payum/blob/master/src/Payum/Core/Model/Token.php)
    
2. Payum contacts the payment provider (using [php-http/guzzle6-adapter](https://github.com/php-http/guzzle6-adapter)),
passing the payment details and the success url.
    
3. The payment provider usually answers with a payment url, unique for this payment.
  
4. Payum sends a HTTP-302-Redirect to the user, referring them to the payment provider.
    
5. After the user has finished the transaction, the payment provider sends them back to your success url.
    
6. Upon this request you have to check the status of the payment and mark it as completed.
    
So to get you up and running, all you need is:

* Credentials of your payment provider.
