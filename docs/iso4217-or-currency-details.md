# ISO4217 or Currency Details. 

Payum provides ability to get currency details listed in [ISO4217](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) specification.
To get this information you have to execute a GetCurrency request with a currency code.


```php
<?php

use Payum\Core\Request\GetCurrency;

$factory = new \Payum\Offline\OfflineGatewayFactory();
$gateway = $factory->create();

$gateway->execute($currency = new GetCurrency('USD'));

echo $currency->getAlpha3();  // USD
echo $currency->getName();    // US Dollar
echo $currency->getExp();     // 2
echo $currency->getCountry(); // US

// and so on...
```

Or inside another action:

```php
<?php

use Payum\Core\Action\ActionInterface;
use Payum\Core\GatewayAwareInterface;
use Payum\Core\GatewayAwareTrait;
use Payum\Core\Request\GetCurrency;

class FooAction implements ActionInterface, GatewayAwareInterface
{
    use GatewayAwareTrait;
    
    public function execute($request)
    {
        $this->gateway->execute($currency = new GetCurrency('USD'));
        
        echo $currency->getAlpha3();  // USD
        echo $currency->getName();    // US Dollar
        echo $currency->getExp();     // 2
        echo $currency->getCountry(); // US
    }
}
```

Or directly ISO4217 service:

```php
<?php

use Payum\Core\ISO4217\Currency;

$currency = Currency::createFromIso4217Alpha3('USD');

echo $currency->getAlpha3();  // USD
echo $currency->getName();    // US Dollar
echo $currency->getExp();     // 2
echo $currency->getCountry(); // US
```
