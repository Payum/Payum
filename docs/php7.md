# PHP7

Payum works on PHP 7, though some features are not supported yet:

* Doctrine MongoODM storage is not supported, because it relies on the legacy PHP extension Mongo. The extension is planned to be updated for PHP 7.
* The Authorize.NET AIM official library does not support PHP 7 yet.
* KlarnaInvoice uses the XMLRPC library, which is not compatible with PHP 7 yet.

* [Back to index](index.md).
